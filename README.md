# liri-node-app

#### The LIRI node app will allow you to search for movies, songs, and tweets. 
##### For Tweets
enter *node liri my-tweets* to display the latest tweets from Trika_Mitra.
##### For Songs
enter *node liri spotify-this-song* followed by the song of your choice to gather song information from the spotify API.
##### For Movies
enter *node liri movie-this* followed by the movie of your choice to get movie information from the OMDB API.
##### Or... For fun...
enter *node do-what-it-says* to allow liri to get information from the __random.txt__ file and execute the relevant code.
__ALSO__ note that all of the data is printed to the log.txt file.
### This was made using
